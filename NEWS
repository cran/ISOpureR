ISOpureR 1.0.8 2015-01-07
==========================

Minor update
-------------
- removed RcppEigen from the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file, and added to LinkedTo
  field only
- changed the data in inst/extdata/Beer to use a part of Beer data with 1000 transcripts, 
  30 patients in order to further decrease the memory use


ISOpureR 1.0.7 2014-12-18
==========================

Minor update
-------------
- edited the .cpp file to use RcppEigen::Map which means the matrix is not copied, but
  accessed from the same memory location


ISOpureR 1.0.6 2014-12-16
==========================

Major update
-------------
- used RcppEigen to create a C++ function wrapped into R that finds the maximum over columns,
  which improves run time 2-3 fold on the Beer dataset (both full and subset in package)
- the package now depends on Rcpp and RcppEigen


ISOpureR 1.0.5 2014-11-20
==========================

Minor update
-------------
- added NEWS file

bug fixes
---------
- DESCRIPTION FILE - updated date, was incorrect in previous version
- changed the tests in inst/tests to use the updated data with 2500 transcripts, 43 patients
- these tests are not really accessible to users, but are used to test the code in the vignette
  without having to run code in the vignette when loading (as it takes too long)


ISOpureR 1.0.4 2014-11-16
==========================

Minor update
-------------
- changed the data in inst/extdata/Beer to use a part of Beer data with 2500 transcripts, 
  43 patients and ISOpureS2model was also rounded, in order to comply with CRAN memory 
  requirements
